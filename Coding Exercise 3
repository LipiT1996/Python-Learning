"""
The FizzBuzz challenge

In this exercise, print out 100 numbers, from 1 to 100 (both inclusive). But:

Instead of printing multiples of 3, print "Fizz"

Instead of printing multiples of 5, print "Buzz"

Instead of printing multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

That means your program will print a combination of numbers, Fizz , Buzz , and FizzBuzz .

    print("FizzBuzz")
  elif i % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  elif i % 5 == 0:

  else:
    print(i)
